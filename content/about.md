Hi, I'm Woosang, currently a CS undergraduate at a college in Upstate New York. My interest lies on creating resilient backend services (especially for Go), building foolproof measures for development procedures (e.g. CI pipelines), and tweaking Emacs configs.

On my spare time, I like to [make music](https://youtu.be/qyQLNk6QoJk), hike mountains and chill with my cats.
