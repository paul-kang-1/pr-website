Hi, I'm Woosang, currently a CS student at an Upstate college with a glum weather in the States. My interest lies on creating resilient backend services (especially for Go), different modes of communications (gRPC, AMQP, etc), and tweaking Emacs configs.

On my spare time, I like to [make music](https://youtu.be/qyQLNk6QoJk), hike mountains and chill with my cats.
