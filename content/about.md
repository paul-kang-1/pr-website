Hi, I'm Woosang, currently a CS undergraduate at a college in Upstate New York. My interest lies on creating resilient backend services (especially for Go) and implementing build systems.

On my spare time, I like to [make music](https://youtu.be/qyQLNk6QoJk), hike mountains and chill with my cats.
